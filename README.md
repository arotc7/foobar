# foobar

If you haven't heard of Google Foobar, it is one of Google's recruiting techniques. If you google search enough computer science terms, they might give you a link to it. Google Foobar is a set of programming challenges that are presented in increasing difficulty in order to test someone's aptitude for programming. If you are able to get far enough in their challenge, it is possible that they might give you an interview!

Here are my solutions for several of the google foobar problems. The first one especially is not well programmed since I was not aware of what classes I was/was not able to use. The later solutions have some better programming practices.
